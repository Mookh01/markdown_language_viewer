# markdown_language_viewer
A FreeCodeCamp Project using React.js to create a real-time markdown language viewer

# Objective:
Build an app that allows you to write markdown language and Preview your results in real time. 

1. User Story: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.

2. User Story: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

3. You can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked

# Challanges:
Deprecated code and updating references to ES6 was some of my bigger challenges. I also find the documentation from many of the add-on libraries to be vague.  
Finding examples and referencing the React github https://facebook.github.io/react/ is the best solution.  Its still hard for me to wrap my head around the usage of refs and props but with more practice I believe this will become easier.
